<h1>Script 1: Video Captions</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Use the increased use of videos as an argument to highlight the relevance of this topic. Emphasize that video content can be beneficial to accessibility, when it is implemented correctly. Explain the need for captioning for people with hearing impairments. Describe the complementary benefits for others, especially for people with lower language skills, people in loud environments, people is silent environments, and for privacy.</p>
