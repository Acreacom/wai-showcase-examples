<h1>Script 6: Notifications and Feedback</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation of unclear instructions and error messages. Emphasize that clear notifications and feedback is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people who are new to computer or who don't know the website. Include some examples of what good notifications and feedback entails.</p>
