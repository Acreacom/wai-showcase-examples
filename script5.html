<h1>Script 5: Clear Layout and Design</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation of convoluted layouts. Emphasize that good layout and design is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people using mobile devices and people in a hurry. Include some examples of what good layout and design entails.</p>
