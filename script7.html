<h1>Script 7: Large Click Areas</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation with too small click/touch areas. Emphasize that large click areas is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people who are using mobile devices, especially on the go. Include some examples of what is meant by large click areas.</p>
