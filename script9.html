<h1>Script 9: Simple Language</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation of complex language. Make references to presentation, which needs to be considered along with language. Emphasize that simple language and presentation is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people new to computers and with lower computer skills, new to the website, unfamiliar with the subject matter, or in a hurry and distracted. Include some examples of what simple language entails.</p>
