Some people can't see the text on this screen.

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,480
Fortunately, computers can convert text to speech.

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,580
It's technology that many people who are blind have been relying on for years.

00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,180
But it's also important for many people with dyslexia.

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,020
And very useful for people who have difficulty reading text.

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,000
As well as some people who just like to multitask.

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,020
But for this to work

00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,040
Websites and apps have to be properly coded.

00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites' contents better.

00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,740
Web accessibility

00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,180
Essential for some, useful for all.
