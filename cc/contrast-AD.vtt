00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Audio Descriptions>Signs with directions are shown

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Audio Descriptions>A woman is walking happily down the street

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.320
There's something about great design

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.920
that allows it to go practically unnoticed.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.740
but it doesn't take much to make thing confusing and frustrating

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Audio Descriptions>The signs change to have poor contrast

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.560
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman now looks confused

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.560
Choosing colors with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.840
a real pain

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Audio Descriptions>She looks at a navigation app on her phone

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.740
Good design mean sufficient contrast between foreground background and colors

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.720
That's not just text and images but links

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.540
icons and buttons

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Audio Descriptions>The app has a button with low contrast

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Audio Descriptions>that changes to become clear

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.700
If it's important enough to be seen then it needs to be clear

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.720
and this is essential for people with low-contrast sensitivity
If it's important enough to be seen then it needs to be clear

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.680
and this is essential for people with low-contrast sensitivity

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.000
which becomes more common as we age

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Audio Descriptions>An older man on a sofa is looking at a tablet

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.120
<v Audio Descriptions>He goes to read a message on his mobile phone

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.920
With good colors websites and applications can be easier to use in more situations

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.460
like in different lighting conditions

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Audio Descriptions>Sun glares on the phone

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Audio Descriptions>but the text is still readable

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800
Web accessibility

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.720
Essential for some, useful for all.
