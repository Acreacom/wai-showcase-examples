WEBVTT

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.020
Poor layout can be very frustrating

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Audio Descriptions>A man in a kitchen is looking for thing to make a coffee

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.360
and the same applies to the web.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.300
Good design involves good layout

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.820
and that means a better user experience.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Audio Descriptions>The man is frustrated about not finding what he is looking for

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Audio Descriptions>The man rearranges the kitchen in a time-lapse

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.560
This includes clear headings, navigation bars

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.560
and consistent styling.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Audio Descriptions>The man is now browsing a badly laid out pizza delivery website

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Audio Descriptions>and is shaking his head.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.000
Any web-user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Audio Descriptions>A woman is using the same complex website with screen magnification.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Audio Descriptions>She only sees a portion of the screen at a time

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Audio Descriptions>so the website appears even more confusing

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.980
Complex layouts also make finding information difficult

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.840
or impossible for people with visual disabilities.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman is shaking her head

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.640
<v Audio Descriptions>and is unable to use that website

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.540
and they are confusing for people with cognitive and learning disabilities

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.440
who need clarity and consistency of the presentation

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Audio Descriptions>The man calls a friend over to help

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120
<v Audio Descriptions>The friend is just as confused and navigates to a different

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Audio Descriptions>better pizza website

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.780
Bad design also impacts anyone who isn't particularly

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.780
confident around computers

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Audio Descriptions>This second website is much clearer and easier to use

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.200
<v Audio Descriptions>They are both happy

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman using screen magnification has also used that website

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Audio Descriptions>and is delightfully eating a pizza

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Web accessibility

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.020
Essential for some, useful for all.
