00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.120
Trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.340
Many websites and applications try to thread the needle

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman fails to tap small links on a website

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.420
But on the web

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.120
we can make areas for clicking and tapping easier to use

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Audio Descriptions>The links become larger in size and the woman now easily taps them

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.440
Which is handy on mobile devices

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.120
especially when we might be moving around at the time

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.860
<v Audio Descriptions>and fails to click small buttons on a website

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Audio Descriptions>The buttons become larger

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Audio Descriptions>and the woman with the tremor is now able to click them

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.900
Web accessibility

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.900
Essential for some, useful for all.
