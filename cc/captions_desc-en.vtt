00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Audio Descriptions>A man sat at a desk starts watching a video on his computer. 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.160
Video isn’t just about pictures - it’s also about sound.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.280
Without the audio, you’d have to guess what this film is about

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.780
<v Audio Descriptions>The video on his computer shows a person speaking to the camera.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Audio Descriptions>It is playing with no audio.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.880
Frustrating isn’t it? Not knowing what’s going on.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Audio Descriptions>The man watching the video has a hearing aid.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.840
That’s the situation for everyone who can’t hear.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Audio Descriptions>He turns on captions for the video playing.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.520
Captions make videos accessible.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.720
Which is also handy for people who want to watch video in loud environments

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Audio Descriptions>Another man is watching the captioned video 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.860
<v Audio Descriptions>with a group of people chatting away next to him.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.040
Or where you need to be very, very quiet.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Audio Descriptions>Turns out they are in a library.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Audio Descriptions>The group is shushed by the librarian.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Audio Descriptions>The video is shown playing with the captions on.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.900
Web accessibility: essential for some, useful for all.
