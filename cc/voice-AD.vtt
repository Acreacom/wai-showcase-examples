Sometimes it's just easier to speak.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.620
One of the advances of technology is voice recognition

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.060

<v Audio Descriptions>A man with a wheelchair is using a headset for the computer

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.860

<v Audio Descriptions>Nothing happens on the computer

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.980
<v man in wheelchair>"Cancel?"
