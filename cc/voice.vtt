Imagine if you could only communicate with your family by writing.

0:00:09.041 --> 0:00:12.480
Sometimes it's just easier to speak.

0:00:12.481 --> 0:00:16.360
One of the advances of technology is voice recognition.

0:00:16.361 --> 0:00:18.000
Whether it's searching the Web:

0:00:18.001 --> 0:00:20.000
"Nineteenth Century Architecture."

0:00:20.001 --> 0:00:21.200
Dictating emails:

0:00:21.201 --> 0:00:25.180
"Send email to Jack Harding."

0:00:25.181 --> 0:00:28.120
Or controlling your navigation app.

0:00:28.760 --> 0:00:32.740
Many people with physical disabilities rely on voice recognition

0:00:32.740 --> 0:00:33.940
to use the computer.

0:00:33.941 --> 0:00:35.380
"Place order."

0:00:35.381 --> 0:00:39.120
But for that to happen websites and apps need to be properly coded.

0:00:39.121 --> 0:00:42.160
"Go? Cancel?"

0:00:42.161 --> 0:00:44.920
Voice recognition could help lots of other people

0:00:44.921 --> 0:00:47.740
with temporary limitations too, like an injured arm.

0:00:47.741 --> 0:00:48.740
"Place order."

0:00:48.741 --> 0:00:51.240
It can also prevent injuries becoming worse.

0:00:51.240 --> 0:00:54.400
like RSI: repetitive stress injury.

0:00:54.401 --> 0:00:57.020
Or for people simply preferring voice.

0:00:57.021 --> 0:00:59.020
Web accessibility

0:00:59.021 --> 0:01:00.160
"Place Order."

0:01:00.161 --> 0:01:03.120
Essential for some, useful for all.
