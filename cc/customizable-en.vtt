00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,080
What's right for you

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,180
doesn't necessarily work for the next person.

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,200
Customization isn't always just a question of preference though.

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,060
Sometimes, it's a necessity.

00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:22,740
Being able to adjust the text is crucial with low vision and dyslexia.

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,620
Properly coded websites and applications allow the text to be customized.

00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,080
For example, to change its size, spacing, font, and colors

00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,620
without loss of functions or clarity.

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,420
Web accessibility

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,620
Essential for some, useful for all.
