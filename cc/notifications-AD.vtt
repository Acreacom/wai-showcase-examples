00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.380
All the right gears can be put in motion

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Audio Descriptions>The hands on a cuckoo clock reach twelve

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.580
The hands can be at the exact place they need to be

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.580
but if you don't get the response that you're expecting

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.260
you'll end up wonder if there's some sort of problem.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Audio Descriptions>but the cuckoo bird does not pop out of its door to signal the time

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.460
It's the same on the web

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060
without clear notifications and feedback

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.040
people are quickly disorientated and confused.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Audio Descriptions>A man completes and submits a form on a website

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Audio Descriptions>to get a rather blank screen

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Audio Descriptions>with no confirmation of his submission

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Audio Descriptions>He looks confused

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.260
especially error messages which are often complex and confusing

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Audio Descriptions>Another man receives a technical error message

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.660
<v Audio Descriptions>from a website registration form

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.460
<v Audio Descriptions>It reads: "Error ead#234532 invalid data"

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.100
Yet making them understandable is usually quite simple

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Audio Descriptions>The error message changes to say:

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Audio Descriptions>"Invalid format, required format is 'day/month/year'

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.600
Making websites and apps predictable and understandable

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.660
makes them accessible for people with cognitive and learning disabilities.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Audio Descriptions>A woman is trying to log into the Wi-Fi of a cafe

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.840
<v Audio Descriptions>and receives a cryptic error message

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.840
and more usable for everyone.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Audio Descriptions>other people at the cafe also seem to be having this problem

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.760
Especially people with lower computer skills

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Audio Descriptions>The error message changes to something more understandable.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Audio Descriptions>The woman at the cafe looks relieved.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.880
<v Audio Descriptions>The cuckoo bird pops out of the clock.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.680
Web accessibility

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.200
Essential for some, useful for all.
