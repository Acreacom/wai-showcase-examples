00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.820
<v Audio Descriptions>Two people are trying to follow instructions

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Audio Descriptions>on a cooking website

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Audio Descriptions>Using lots of text with no illustrations or structure

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.060
Instead of saying

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.420
To postulate a conceit more irksome than

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.760
being addressed in sesquipedalian syntax is adamantine

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.900
It is better to say

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.760
being spoken to in unnecessarily long and

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.880
complicated language is a pain

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.280
<v Audio Descriptions>They are looking up words in a dictionary

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Audio Descriptions>to understand the recipe

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
Yet many websites lack structuring

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.180
using headings, lists and separation 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.920
or they use overly complex language

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.300
jargon and unexplained acronyms

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Audio Descriptions>They are confused and frustrated by the website

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.840
It makes them difficult and unappealing to use for many people

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.840
including non-native speakers

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.880
and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Audio Descriptions>They search and find a different cooking website

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.380
<v Audio Descriptions>with more structured text and illustrations

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.040
Web accessibility

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.880
Essential for some, useful for all.
