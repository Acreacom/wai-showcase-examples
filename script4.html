<h1>Script 4: Text to Speech</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

Connect this to the need for people with different disabilities, and emphasize the face they people rely on this technology. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people wanting to listen rather than and people with low literacy.
