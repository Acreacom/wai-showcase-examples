<h1>Script 4: Text to Speech</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Demonstrate the broad variety of use cases for text to speech and its increased deployment, especially in mobile devices. Connect this to the need for people with different disabilities, and emphasize the face they people rely on this technology. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for people wanting to listen rather than and people with low literacy. Emphasize that this is mostly a matter of proper coding and include some examples of what that means. Reiterate that such proper coding benefits many users.</p>
