<h1>Script 3: Voice Recognition</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Demonstrate the broad variety of use cases for voice recognition and its increased deployment, especially in mobile devices. Connect this to the need for people with physical disabilities, and emphasize the face they people rely on this technology. Also highlight the complementary benefits, for example for repetitive stress injury, broken arm, and possibly others. Emphasize that this is mostly a matter of proper coding and include some examples of what that means. Reiterate that such proper coding benefits many users.</p>
