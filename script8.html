<h1>Script 8: Text Customization</h1>
<p><a href="Overview.html">&lt; Scripts for Showcase Examples with Videos</a></p>

<p>Relate the issue to the personal experience of the reader/viewer, as most will have encountered a situation of illegible text. Use different examples to illustrate the variety of people impacted by text customization. Refer to mobile apps and content formats, which often pose specific challenges regarding text customization. Emphasize that text customization is good practice in addition to an accessibility requirement.</p>
